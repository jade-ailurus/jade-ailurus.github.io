                            Research is often portrayed as a linear journey from question to answer. The reality,
                            I've found, is far more circuitous and infinitely more interesting.
                        </p>

                        <h2>The Myth of the Eureka Moment</h2>
                        <p>
                            Popular culture loves the story of sudden insight—Newton's apple, Archimedes' bathtub.
                            But real research rarely works this way. Progress comes through countless small steps,
                            failed experiments, and ideas that seem promising but lead nowhere.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This isn't discouraging; it's liberating. Understanding that struggle is part of the
                            process removes the pressure to have brilliant insights on demand.
                        </p>

                        <h2>The Value of Being Stuck</h2>
                        <p>
                            Some of my most productive periods have come after being thoroughly stuck on a problem.
                            The frustration of not understanding something deeply drives a kind of engagement that
                            casual interest never achieves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When stuck, I try to articulate exactly what I don't understand. Often, the act of
                            precisely stating my confusion reveals the path forward.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Collaboration and Solitude</h2>
                        <p>
                            Research requires both. Conversations with others expose blind spots in my thinking
                            and introduce perspectives I'd never find alone. But deep work requires extended
                            periods of focused solitude.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finding the right balance is an ongoing challenge. Too much isolation leads to
                            tunnel vision; too much collaboration fragments attention.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Writing as Thinking</h2>
                        <p>
                            I've come to believe that writing isn't just how we communicate research—it's how
                            we do research. The act of explaining something precisely often reveals gaps in
                            understanding that felt solid in my head.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                        <p>
                            As I continue on this path, I try to maintain the curiosity that drew me to research
                            in the first place. The questions that excite me may change, but the fundamental
                            drive to understand remains constant.
                        </p>
