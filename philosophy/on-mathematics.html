                        <h2>Discovery or Invention?</h2>
                        <p>
                            This is perhaps the oldest question in the philosophy of mathematics, and I don't pretend to have a definitive answer.
                            But my experience suggests it's both. The structures we study feel discovered, as if they exist independently of us.
                            Yet the frameworks we use to understand them are clearly human constructions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What matters more to me is that mathematics provides a language for precision. When I can express an idea mathematically,
                            I know I understand it. When I cannot, there's still work to be done.
                        </p>

                        <h2>The Role of Beauty</h2>
                        <p>
                            Mathematical beauty is real and important. A beautiful proof is usually a sign that you've found the "right" way
                            to think about a problem. Ugliness, conversely, often indicates that something is being forced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But beauty alone isn't sufficient. A beautiful theorem that solves no problems and connects to nothing else
                            is merely a curiosity. The best mathematics is both beautiful and useful.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Abstraction and Intuition</h2>
                        <p>
                            There's a tension in mathematics between abstraction and intuition. Abstraction gives power and generality.
                            Intuition gives understanding and direction. The art is in balancing both.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I try to develop intuition first, then formalize. The formalization often reveals gaps in my intuition,
                            which forces deeper understanding. This cycle of intuition and formalization is how mathematical knowledge grows.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Mathematics as Communication</h2>
                        <p>
                            Mathematics is also a form of communication. A good proof doesn't just establish truth, it explains why something is true.
                            The best mathematical writing anticipates the reader's questions and answers them in sequence.
                        </p>
