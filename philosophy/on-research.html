                        <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
                        <p>
                            Research, for me, is fundamentally about curiosity. It's the desire to understand why things work the way they do,
                            and whether there might be a better way. I find myself drawn to problems that sit at the intersection of
                            theory and practice, where mathematical elegance meets real-world impact.
                        </p>

                        <h2>The Problems That Excite Me</h2>
                        <p>
                            I'm particularly fascinated by optimization problems, especially those that arise in decision-making under uncertainty.
                            There's something deeply satisfying about finding structure in seemingly chaotic systems, and using that structure
                            to make better decisions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The problems I find most compelling often share a common trait: they appear simple on the surface but reveal
                            unexpected depth upon closer examination. These are the problems worth spending time on.
                        </p>

                        <h2>My Approach</h2>
                        <p>
                            I believe in starting with the simplest possible formulation of a problem. Only after understanding the simple case
                            thoroughly do I add complexity. This approach has served me well, preventing me from getting lost in unnecessary
                            abstraction while still maintaining mathematical rigor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Collaboration is also essential to my research philosophy. The best ideas often emerge from conversations,
                            from explaining your thinking to someone else and hearing their perspective in return.
                        </p>

                        <h2>On Failure</h2>
                        <p>
                            Most research directions don't pan out. This is normal and even necessary. Each failed attempt teaches something,
                            refines intuition, and occasionally points toward unexpected discoveries. The key is to fail quickly and learn faster.
                        </p>
