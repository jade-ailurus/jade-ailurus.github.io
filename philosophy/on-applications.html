                        <h2>Theory and Practice</h2>
                        <p>
                            The relationship between theory and practice is symbiotic. Theory without application risks becoming disconnected
                            from reality. Application without theory risks being ad hoc and fragile. The best work, in my view, maintains
                            a dialogue between both.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've found that practical problems often inspire the most interesting theoretical questions. Conversely,
                            theoretical insights frequently suggest new practical approaches that wouldn't have been obvious otherwise.
                        </p>

                        <h2>What Makes a Good Application</h2>
                        <p>
                            A good application of mathematics isn't just about using fancy tools. It's about finding the right level of
                            abstraction for the problem at hand. Too much abstraction loses important details. Too little fails to capture
                            the essential structure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The best applications also provide insight beyond just a solution. They explain why the solution works,
                            when it might fail, and how it might be extended.
                        </p>

                        <h2>On Modeling</h2>
                        <p>
                            All models are wrong, but some are useful. The art of applied mathematics lies in knowing which simplifications
                            preserve the essential features of a problem and which destroy them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I believe in iterative modeling: start simple, validate against reality, add complexity where needed.
                            This approach builds understanding incrementally and avoids over-engineering.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Impact</h2>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, applied mathematics should make a difference. Whether that's improving a decision-making process,
                            enabling a new technology, or providing insight into a complex system, the goal is impact beyond the paper.
                        </p>
